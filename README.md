# Amazon-delivery
First Project
Amazon is the worldâ€™s leading e-commerce website that aims at providing convenient door
to door delivery for every individual around the world. They aim to provide hassle free
delivery for their customers. 
In this project, Firstly, a customer logs into his account on the website.
Secondly, he then starts to check out the products along with their quantity and then, places
an order. A bill will be displayed and he would be prompted to pay for the purchase. He
may choose between several payment methods and finally, he makes the purchase. A
customer also has the provision to track the order. If the customer is a seller, he has the
provision to add new products into the database.
Feedback is important for a huge company like amazon and therefore the customer is asked
to give feedback while quitting.
